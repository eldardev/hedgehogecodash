# Hedgehog Eco Dash

In this mobile strategy game, you will embark on an exciting adventure with hedgehogs as your loyal units. With your confident leadership, you can guide your hedgehogs to success! Your task is to collect and deliver various fruits and objects, and these spiky creatures rely on your guidance to navigate through a cleverly designed environment. Each hedgehog can carry assets and exchange them with others or place them in temporary storage buffers like baskets or stumps. The game introduces a twist with the appearance of obstacles on the paths that impede your hedgehogs' progress. It is your responsibility to remove and sort through this debris, ensuring the paths are clear for your hedgehogs to proceed. You can transfer assets between highlighted units to strategize your moves. Delivering assets to the correct exit points will boost your score, but be cautious, as incorrect deliveries will penalize you. The game will end if the score falls below a certain threshold. The level is completed when a specific number of hedgehogs exit, assets are delivered, and points are scored within the given time limit. This game offers a balance of charming graphics, environmental awareness, and strategic gameplay that will undoubtedly captivate and amuse you.
